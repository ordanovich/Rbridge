## :bridge_at_night: R-ArcGIS bridge 

[R-ArcGIS bridge](https://r-arcgis.github.io/), developed and maintained by [Esri](https://www.esri.com/en-us/home), is a little-known secret to extend the functionality of geoprocessing tools in ArcGIS.

> As a data scientist, you might use several tools that help you answer complicated questions about patterns and relationships that occur in the data you are working with. R is one of those tools that provides a variety of packages containing functions for (geo)statistical analysis. Using the bridge between R and ArcGIS, you can easily access geographic data and take advantage of ArcGIS software while performing your analysis using R functions such as base. It is also possible to convert these R scripts into geoprocessing tools and run them directly in ArcGIS as a typical standalone or built-in in a ModelBuilder workflow tool.

## :hospital: Extensions for the Web Portal for Health and Population in Spain

Here you can access the source scripts of the geoprocessing tools built upon the **arcgisbinding** package. To start you off, we have developed three tools that are thought to be executed sequentially.

### :one: Retrieve data from Eurostat
### :two: Apply transformation to the dataset
### :three: Create a ternary composition map

:+1: This PR looks great - it's ready to merge! :shipit:
