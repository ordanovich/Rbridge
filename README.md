## R-ArcGIS extensions for the Web Portal for Health and Population in Spain

[R-ArcGIS bridge](https://r-arcgis.github.io/), developed and maintained by [Esri](https://www.esri.com/en-us/home), is a little-known secret :fire: to extend the functionality of geoprocessing tools in ArcGIS.

> Data scientists use several tools that help them answer complicated questions about patterns and relationships that occur in the data. R is one of those tools that provides a variety of packages that contain functions for statistical analysis. Using the bridge between R and ArcGIS, data scientists can easily access geographic data and take advantage of ArcGIS software while performing an analysis using R functions such as base. Scripts created in R or RStudio can be structured to use the bridge to access to ArcGIS-specific data or analysis tools along with other analysis functions or R-specific data manipulations. These scripts can be converted into tools for geoprocessing and run them directly in ArcGIS as a typical, or built-in tool in a ModelBuilder workflow. One of the many benefits of using the R-ArcGIS bridge is the ability to create and execute a geoprocessing tool using a script that contains functions R.
